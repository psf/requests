How to Help
===========

Requests is under active development, and contributions are more than welcome!

#. Check for open issues or open a fresh issue to start a discussion around a feature idea or a bug.
   There is a Contributor Friendly tag for issues that should be ideal for people who are not very
   familiar with the codebase yet.
#. Fork `the repository`_ on Github to start making your changes to the **develop**
   branch (or branch off of it).
#. Write a test which shows that the bug was fixed or that the feature works as expected.
#. Send a pull request and bug the maintainer until it gets merged and published. :)
   Make sure to add yourself to AUTHORS_.

What Needs to be Done
