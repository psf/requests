# httpbin(1): HTTP Request & Response Service

This is a fork of the original httpbin project, which is located at https://github.com/postmanlabs/httpbin

Why fork?  we were unable to get ahold of the folks at postmanlabs to maintain the original project, and httpbin is used for other packages within the python ecosystem, such as [pytest-httpbin](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-httpbin/) which is in turn used by packages such as [requests](https://github.com/psf/requests/blob/main/requirements-dev.txt#L4) so we have forked this package.  That means that httpbin.org is not actually backed by this repo, but the [httpbin package](https://pypi.org/project/httpbin/) is.  Confusing right?  Know anyone at postmanlabs?  [get in touch](mailto:me@kevinmccarthy.org).

httpbin is a [Kenneth Reitz](http://kennethreitz.org/) Project.

## Downloading and Running

```sh
docker pull ghcr.io/psf/httpbin
docker run -p 80:8080 ghcr.io/psf/httpbin
```

## Using `httpbin` as a Library

`httpbin` can be used as a dependency in your own projects by simply adding
`httpbin` as a dependency.

## Manually Building the Latest Docker Image

To build the Docker image yourself, download the latest `Dockerfile` and
`requirements.txt` files from the [release page][release-page]. Store both file
in the same folder and run:

```sh
docker build --build-arg APP_VERSION=<your-version> [other docker args] .
```

Alternatively, you can re-generate a new `requirements.txt` file using
[pip-compile][pip-compile]. In that case, be aware that the code has not been
tested against those dependencies and we cannot guarantee that such an image
will run without errors.

Where `APP_VERSION` will be stored in a docker-label. The default value is an
empty-string.

## Maintenance

### "Extra" Dependencies

The project provides two "extras" which contain dependencies that should only
be installed for specific use-cases. They will not be included when using
`httpbin` as a dependency, unless they are *explicitly* requested like
`httpbin[mainapp]`.

* `mainapp`: Includes everything needed to run `httpbin` as a standalone app.
  This is used by the docker image.
* `test`: Includes additional dependencies for unit-testing. This is only used
  during development.

### Publishing a new Release

Releases (both docker and pypi) are automated via GitHub Actions (See #17).

For *pypi* releases, the project uses [trusted-publishing][tp] via [the official
GitHub action][pypi-action].

For releases on *docker-hub* (when enabled in the CI), the following two
secrets are required:

* `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME`
* `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN`

Releases are triggered on commits tagged with `release-` (for example
`release-0.10.0`).
