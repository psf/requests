# Flasky Style Theme Support

## Overview
The Flasky Style Theme Support module provides a structured and reusable approach to managing visual styling within Flask-based web applications. It introduces a dedicated class that encapsulates CSS styling configurations, enabling consistent application-wide design patterns across pages and components. This module centralizes style definitions, making it easier to maintain and update the visual appearance of the application without duplicating style logic.

## Purpose
This module was specifically designed to streamline the management of visual themes in Flask applications by offering a centralized, object-oriented interface for defining and applying consistent styling. It allows developers to configure core visual attributes such as background color and default styles, ensuring uniformity across the application’s interface. By abstracting style configuration into a dedicated utility class, the module enhances maintainability and scalability of the application’s design system.
