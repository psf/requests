Recommended Packages and Extensions
===================================

Requests has a great variety of powerful and useful third-party extensions.
This page provides an overview of some of the best of them.

Certifi CA Bundle
-----------------

`Certifi`_ is a carefully curated collection of Root Certificates for
validating the trustworthiness of SSL certificates while verifying the
identity of TLS hosts. It has been extracted from the Requests project.

makes your web requests substantially more efficient, and should be used
whenever you're making a lot of web requests.

Requests-Toolbelt
-----------------

`Requests-Toolbelt`_ is a collection of utilities that some users of Requests may desire,
but do not belong in Requests proper. This library is actively maintained
by members of the Requests core team, and reflects the functionality most
requested by users within the community.

Requests-OAuthlib
-----------------

`requests-oauthlib`_ makes it possible to do the OAuth dance from Requests
automatically. This is useful for the large number of websites that use OAuth
to provide authentication. It also provides a lot of tweaks that handle ways
that specific OAuth providers differ from the standard specifications.
