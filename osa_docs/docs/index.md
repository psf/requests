# Flasky Style Theme Support

## Overview
The Flasky Style Theme Support module provides a structured, object-oriented approach to managing visual styling within Flask-based web applications. It introduces a dedicated class that encapsulates CSS styling configurations, enabling consistent and centralized control over the application’s visual design. By defining core visual attributes such as background color and default styles in a single, reusable component, this module ensures uniformity across all pages and UI components. The design promotes maintainability and scalability by abstracting style logic away from individual templates and views, allowing developers to update the application’s appearance globally with minimal effort.

## Purpose
This module was specifically developed to streamline the management of visual themes in Flask applications. It serves as a centralized utility for defining and applying consistent styling patterns, reducing code duplication and improving the coherence of the user interface. By providing a dedicated interface for configuring visual attributes, it enhances the developer experience when building and maintaining complex web applications with consistent design systems.
