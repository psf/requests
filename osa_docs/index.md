# Requests

## Overview
Requests is a Python library designed to simplify the process of making HTTP requests. It provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with web services, handling common tasks such as sending GET and POST requests, managing cookies, and supporting various authentication mechanisms.

## Purpose
The primary purpose of Requests is to serve as a high-level, intuitive HTTP client for Python, enabling developers to easily perform HTTP operations without dealing with low-level details like connection management, headers, or encoding. It abstracts away the complexity of the underlying `urllib3` library while offering robust support for cookies, authentication, and session management, making it ideal for web scraping, API integration, and general web interaction tasks.
