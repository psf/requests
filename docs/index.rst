**Requests** is an elegant and simple HTTP library for Python, built for human beings.

-------------------

**Behold, the power of Requests**::

    >>> r = requests.get('https://api.github.com/user', auth=('user', 'pass'))
    >>> r.status_code
    200
    >>> r.headers['content-type']
    'application/json; charset=utf8'
    >>> r.encoding
    'utf-8'
    >>> r.text
    '{"type":"User"...'
    >>> r.json()
    {'private_gists': 419, 'total_private_repos': 77, ...}

See `similar code, sans Requests <https://gist.github.com/973705>`_.


**Requests** allows you to send HTTP/1.1 requests extremely easily. 
There's no need to manually add query strings to your
URLs, or to form-encode your POST data. Keep-alive and HTTP connection pooling
are 100% automatic, thanks to `urllib3 <https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3>`_.
