        :param pool_timeout:
            If set and the pool is set to block=True, then this method will
            block for ``pool_timeout`` seconds and raise EmptyPoolError if no
            connection is available within the time period.

        :param release_conn:

    Given a url, return an :class:`.ConnectionPool` instance of its host.

    This is a shortcut for not having to parse out the scheme, host, and port
    of the url before creating an :class:`.ConnectionPool` instance.

    :param url:
        Absolute URL string that must include the scheme. Port is optional.

    :param \**kw:
        Passes additional parameters to the constructor of the appropriate
        :class:`.ConnectionPool`. Useful for specifying things like
        timeout, maxsize, headers, etc.

    Example: ::

        >>> conn = connection_from_url('http://google.com/')
        >>> r = conn.request('GET', '/')
